# My Github account will be a collection of any websites that need to be uploaded and shared for any assignments I may have in the future. 
# The repository I created only consists of my Portfolio Project for now. 
# I created a repository on Github then I cloned it to my computer and transferred my portfolio project files over to the folder I cloned from Github.
